# OrderBook
## Description
* This project is being designed for Quantiative Trading Club at UIC to used in the future as a learning experience.
* We intend to add features that allows users to interact with a simulated market using this order book system.
* We also intend to develop trading algorithms that use financial mathematics to make trades based on information derived from the orderbook. 

# Tech Stack 
* C++20 + API integration later down the line

# How to contribute :scream:
* This website is helpful: [https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/]
* Navigate to an open workspace
* git clone https://github.com/Mohpann/OrderBook.git
* Write your code
## To commit your changes to the repository:
* git init
* git remote add origin https://github.com/Mohpann/OrderBook.git
* We commit to the main branch so make sure you're on it using git branch
* If not -> git checkout main (main should be highlighted in your terminal output)
## Now you can commit changes :writing_hand:
* git add . (add files in working directory to your commit)
* git commit (commit changes to be sent)
* git push origin main (push to your origin repo on the main branch)
* Pray :pray:


## Note
* c++20 is required for the contains() method to work on unordered maps.
* Navigate to .vscode/c_cpp_properties.json and modify cppStandard to be "c++20"

### OrderBook design is based on CodingJesus' YouTube tutorials [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeLWe0Cx_Lg]
